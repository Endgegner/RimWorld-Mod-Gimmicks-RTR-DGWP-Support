Link to the Original Mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1526599749 (Author: Chronometrics, Porter: BrokenValkyrie)

BrokenValkyrie stopped working on Toolmetrix, so i decided to maintain the Gimmicks (Part) Only.

<b><font color="#9AB973">Changes</font></b>

  - Lightweight Vanilla-friendly Edition
  - Redesigned for early stages
  - Slightly retextured and refined
  - Supports english and german language
  - Template for other Translations
  - Flowers cant be crafted anymore. Theyre special, right? Exotic Traders only
  - Recipes adjusted, Tools are unstackable now
  - Removed the material part to make them unique, and easier to identify
  - Removed Toolkits. Should be a different mod

The upcoming Tools turned out to be way too usefull, make the life overall easier for a small colony and the game just way more fun by speeding things up a bit. Your Scientist grows already grey hair? Take your choice and fix that!

<b><font color="#FFFF99">Item List</font></b>

  - Traders only: Interstellar Encyclopedia, How To, Coupon Book, Flowers
  - Forged #1: Screwdriver, Sickle, Thimble, Whistle
  - Forged #2: Chefs Knife, Skinning Knife, Saw, Shovel
  - Tailored: Pillow
  - Crafted: Whip, Fan
  - Fabricated: Laptop, Smartphone
  - Mechanics: Power Drill, Skill Saw

All new Gimmicks are categorized and findable under &lt;i&gt;Weapons > Tools&lt;/i&gt; in the Storage. Your technological stage matters (Skill too)

<b><font color="#FF9966">Security Warning</font></b>

Remember Tools are Weapons! They're sharp and heavy. Even a pillow can kill someone with enough effort :-)

We take no responsibility for burning colonies beside that, given that no one wants to wear a Gun anymore because of this Tool Extension.

<b><font color="#ED2939">Attention</font></b>

Don't mix this Mod with Toolmetrics Redux by BrokenValkyrie & Chronometrics, this is meant to REPLACE the mod functions in a minimalistic way.

<b><font color="#C970DB">Supported Mods</font></b>

  - Right Tool Rebalanced
 
This adds up exactly the missing Tools you need. Chain Saw any1?
